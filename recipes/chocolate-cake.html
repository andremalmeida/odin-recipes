        <h3>Welcome to recipe of the best chocolate cake</h3>
        <p>A rich super moist chocolate cake with a chocolate buttercream frosting. This is the best cake in the world!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sugar</dt>
            <dd>Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.</dd>
            <dt>Flour</dt>
            <dd>All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.</dd>
            <dt>Cocoa Powder</dt>
            <dd>Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know and love.</dd>
            <dt>Leaveners</dt>
            <dd>Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.</dd>
            <dt>Salt</dt>
            <dd>Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight the other flavors. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll definitely miss the salt if you skip it.</dd>
            <dt>Eggs</dt>
            <dd>Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.</dd>
            <dt>Milk</dt>
            <dd>Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.</dd>
            <dt>Oil</dt>
            <dd>Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.</dd>
            <dt>Vanilla</dt>
            <dd>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.</dd>
            <dt>Boiling Water</dt>
            <dd>You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to create an even higher rise.</dd>
